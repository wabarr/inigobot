This is a stupid twitterbot that uses [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy). 

All it does is to check twitter for recent tweets containing the word "inconceivable". When it finds a match it tweets out "You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means..." and includes a link to the original tweet (this requsults in a 'quote' tweet when rendered in twitter clients).

Note: this assumes you have a file called `inigo_secrets.py` that define your twitter consumer key and access token. You can get these tokens [here](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new).
